\LaTeX{} interacts with fonts differently than most software you are accustomed to.
It does not natively support using system fonts; you can't just choose Comic Sans from a drop-down menu and use it in your document.
(This is probably for the best.)

Nevertheless, \LaTeX{} does support a variety of fonts.
This document will showcase a few that are of high quality and have excellent math support.

\section{Using a font in your document}
To use one of these fonts in a document using one of the Carleton templates, go to the preamble and look for these lines:
\begin{verbatim}
% The Latin Modern font is a modernized replacement for the classic
% Computer Modern. Feel free to replace this with a different font package.
\usepackage{lmodern}
\end{verbatim}
To switch to a different font package, just \emph{replace} \code{lmodern} with the name of that package.
(It is very important not to load multiple font packages; they can conflict and cause strange behavior.)

For example, to us the \code{kpfonts} package, you should replace the third line of the above with the following:
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{kpfonts}
\end{verbatim}
